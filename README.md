## Initscripts for ALDOS

This is the initscripts package contains the basic system scripts used to boot your ALDOS system, change runlevels, and shut the system down cleanly.  It contains the scripts that activate and deactivate most network interfaces.

This fork is specicfically modified for ALDOS and only works in ALDOS. __Do not try to use it anywhere else__. Most likely will break your system.
